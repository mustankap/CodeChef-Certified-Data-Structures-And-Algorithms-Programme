# VR research
## computer vision project
### intern at samsung:
Reverse pass through

reverse pa through AR: people outside can see eyes social presence
face tracking eye hand tracking offset 
camera is on a offset model to generate eyes why simulate dataset
propose a new VR Face dataset to stimulate 
acculution
GAN based model
image to image bidirectional mapping cycle GAN

keep selfie image in the memory  eye and mouth area is overlapped
more collapse
Recon GAN
L1 loss, Lpipd, adversarial
3d mm baseline model used to generate 3d face
nn color expression motion encoder 
triplane
nerf make many 2D features to make a 3d image
potrait 4d

generalizzation: trained with a small dataset but accurately predict unseen circuits
data discontuinity of circuit topologiess
data imbalance less than 1% high quality circuit in the whole dataset

graph transformer bsed network GTN as a surrogate model
circuit performance prediction
topology exploration
redifine topological grphs
