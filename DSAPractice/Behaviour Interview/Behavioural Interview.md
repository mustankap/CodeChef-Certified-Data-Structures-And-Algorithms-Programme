### Tell me about yourself?
Hey, my name is Mustansir. I am a software engineer and i enjoy solving complex problems

i have experience as a full stack web app developer and i enjoy working with all layers of the stack and I enjoy building user friendly efficient web apps. 
shafik@sunrisesys.com
My passion for web app development started when I was doing my internship at Neuraltechsoft and I was given a solo project to work on for the entire period of the internship and this really gave me full ownership over everything from the design descisions to the actual coding of it and I was also able to gain a lot of experience and exposure to different cloud computing tools.

After my internship i decided that this is what I wanted to do as a career and since then Ive gained about 3 years of experience building out dozens of different applications. 

At infosys i was helping out with the mordernization of our existing infrastructure for hitachi-control air. This includes building out new microservices as well as updating existing ones. The technologies i have experience with includes  <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">Java Spring Boot and Node.js for building out APIs. Our server side code SQL with MySQL, Oracle and SQL server</mark> as well as experience with different various javascript frameworks including React JS and Angular.

in my current Role as a masters student in computer science at New Jersey Institute of Technology I'm a teaching assistant for CS104 Computer Programming and Graphics  and a researcher working on System design using Reinforcement Agents
I believe my experience and my passion would make me a great asset for your company.
 So you end on the project
"quick learner"
### Tell me about a time you had to persuade someone at work. What did you do? (even an idea is pursuation)
At my previous company our team supported 20-30 different web applications and there was really no uniformity in terms of what frontend javascript framework we could or should use. So what ended up happening is that we had some apps written in angular some apps written in react some written in vue. It was kinda all over the place and the problem with this was say you were assigned to write a feature in a certain app and you really didn't know that framework you'd have to atleast you know spend time getting a basic understanding of it before you can even start to implement to write that feature. So this potentially increased the development time by a lot . So my proposal was to just have all our apps be written in Angular because its something I had experience in. I thought it was fairly easy to pick up, its a light weight app and you know its pretty easy to inject into existing applications. So what I did was I created a this little mini demo presentation and i set up a meeting between my team and my manager and just demonstrated the pros and cons of using that framework. So the result of that was my manager was onboard and we decided to use Angular for all our new development

#### what are the troubleshooting tools you have used to prevent crashes once you have deployed in production and what were the preventive measures


In my experience with production systems, I've focused on <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">implementing robust monitoring </mark>and<mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;"> preventive measures</mark> that <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">align with</mark> <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">enterprise-level requirements.</mark>

For<mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;"> monitoring and diagnostics</mark>, I primarily use Splunk for log aggregation and analysis, which I understand is a<mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;"> key tool in JPMorgan's observability stack</mark>. I've set up custom dashboards to track critical KPIs (Key Performance Indicators) including response times, error rates, and resource utilization, ensuring we meet SLA requirements.

For preventive measures, I follow a multi-layered approach:

First, I implement comprehensive application logging following standardized patterns that integrate with enterprise logging frameworks. This includes proper exception handling with correlation IDs and structured logging that aids in root cause analysis. At Infosys, I implemented similar practices that reduced MTTR (Mean Time to Resolution) by 30%.

Second, I leverage Jenkins for CI/CD pipelines with automated quality gates, including SonarQube for code quality checks and Fortify for security scanning. This proactive approach helps catch potential issues before they reach production.

For containerized applications in our Kubernetes environment, I implement proper health checks and resource limits. I'm familiar with using Prometheus and Dynatrace for infrastructure monitoring, ensuring we maintain high availability while meeting performance benchmarks.

When incidents occur, I follow structured incident management processes, using tools like ServiceNow for ticket management and Confluence for knowledge base documentation.

#### If you had a new feature on a legacy implementation and something went wrong, what tools would you use to troubleshoot it."


--- 
When troubleshooting a new feature in a legacy system, I would leverage a combination of tools to efficiently identify and resolve the issue.

**Firstly, I would utilize robust logging and monitoring tools.** Tools like **Splunk** or **ELK Stack** would be invaluable for analyzing logs, identifying error patterns, and tracking performance metrics. These tools can help pinpoint the exact location of the problem, whether it's in the application code, database, or infrastructure.

**Secondly, I would employ debugging tools** such as **Java Debugger** or **Python's pdb** to step through the code, inspect variables, and set breakpoints. These tools are essential for understanding the flow of execution and identifying logical errors.

**Thirdly, I would leverage the power of profiling tools** like **YourKit** or **VisualVM** to analyze the performance of the application. By identifying performance bottlenecks, I can optimize the code and improve overall system performance.

**Finally, I would collaborate with the team to brainstorm potential solutions and conduct root cause analysis.** Tools like **Jira** or **Azure DevOps** can be used to track issues, assign tasks, and collaborate effectively.

By combining these tools and techniques, I can efficiently troubleshoot issues, minimize downtime, and ensure the stability of the legacy system.

# Sitetracker:

# SiteTracker Software Engineer Intern Interview Preparation

## Company Overview

SiteTracker is a deployment operations management platform built on Salesforce that helps companies manage critical infrastructure (telecom, utilities, real estate). They work with major clients like British Telecom, KPN, and ChargePoint managing billions in portfolio holdings.

## Expected Interview Questions & STAR Method Answers

### 1. **Technical Architecture & Scalability**

**Question:** "Tell me about a time when you designed a system to handle high concurrent users. How did you approach scalability?"

**STAR Answer:**

- **Situation:** During my internship at Neosoft, I was tasked with building a user profile management system that needed to support thousands of concurrent users.
- **Task:** The system needed to handle 10,000+ concurrent requests while maintaining fast response times and ensuring data consistency.
- **Action:** I designed a distributed architecture using Node.js with Express.js for the API layer, implemented MongoDB with proper indexing strategies, and used Redis for session management and caching. I also implemented connection pooling and database read replicas to distribute load. For the frontend, I used React with Redux for state management to minimize server requests.
- **Result:** Successfully delivered a system supporting 10,000+ concurrent requests with 99.9% uptime, reducing admin processing time by 30% and improving overall system performance.

### 2. **API Design & Performance Optimization**

**Question:** "Describe a situation where you had to optimize API performance. What was your approach?"

**STAR Answer:**

- **Situation:** At Infosys, I was working on the T-Mobile application where users were experiencing slow response times during peak usage.
- **Task:** I needed to optimize API performance to handle 200+ requests per second while maintaining sub-second latency.
- **Action:** I implemented several optimizations: redesigned RESTful APIs using Spring Boot with proper caching strategies, optimized database queries using indexing and query optimization, implemented connection pooling to prevent bottlenecks, and set up load balancing. I also implemented pagination for large datasets and used async processing for non-critical operations.
- **Result:** Reduced overall API latency by 40%, successfully handled 200+ requests per second, and eliminated system bottlenecks, resulting in a 25% improvement in application performance.

### 3. **Problem-Solving & Debugging**

**Question:** "Tell me about a challenging bug you encountered and how you solved it."

**STAR Answer:**

- **Situation:** During the development of my Chaos Chess project, users reported that the game state was becoming inconsistent during online multiplayer sessions, with pieces appearing in different positions for different players.
- **Task:** I needed to identify the root cause of the synchronization issue and implement a solution that would ensure consistent game state across all connected clients.
- **Action:** I debugged the issue by implementing comprehensive logging across the WebSocket connections using ASGI Channels. I discovered that the issue was caused by race conditions when multiple moves were made simultaneously. I implemented a turn-based locking mechanism, added state validation on both client and server sides, and created a reconciliation system that would sync states if discrepancies were detected.
- **Result:** Eliminated synchronization issues, resulting in a 95% reduction in user-reported bugs and enabling smooth multiplayer gameplay for the hackathon win at KJSCE Hack 5.0.

### 4. **Database Design & Optimization**

**Question:** "How would you design a database schema for tracking infrastructure projects with multiple stakeholders?"

**STAR Answer:**

- **Situation:** While working on the file storage system project, I needed to design a database schema that could handle version control, user permissions, and file metadata efficiently.
- **Task:** Create a scalable database design that could track file versions, user access rights, and maintain data integrity across distributed systems.
- **Action:** I designed a normalized database schema with separate tables for files, versions, users, and permissions. Implemented proper indexing strategies on frequently queried fields, used foreign key constraints to maintain referential integrity, and designed the schema to support up to 20 previous versions per file. I also implemented soft deletes and audit trails for compliance.
- **Result:** Created a robust system that efficiently managed file versioning with quick retrieval times and supported complex permission structures, enabling the system to handle large-scale distributed file operations.

### 5. **Authentication & Security**

**Question:** "Describe your experience implementing authentication and authorization systems."

**STAR Answer:**

- **Situation:** At Neosoft, I was responsible for implementing the security layer for the user profile management system that would handle sensitive user data.
- **Task:** Implement robust authentication and authorization that would reduce security incidents while maintaining user experience.
- **Action:** I implemented JWT-based authentication with refresh token rotation, integrated OAuth 2.0 for Google Sign-In, implemented role-based access control (RBAC), added password reset functionality via email verification, and implemented rate limiting to prevent brute force attacks. I also added comprehensive audit logging and input validation to prevent SQL injection and XSS attacks.
- **Result:** Reduced security incidents by 25%, improved user satisfaction by 15% through seamless Google Sign-In integration, and created a security framework that could be reused across other company projects.

### 6. **Machine Learning Integration**

**Question:** "How would you integrate ML capabilities into a business application?"

**STAR Answer:**

- **Situation:** At Infosys, I was tasked with improving the accuracy of an AI chatbot that was providing inconsistent responses to customer queries.
- **Task:** Enhance the chatbot's answer generation accuracy and make it more reliable for customer support operations.
- **Action:** I implemented Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) architecture by fine-tuning LLAMA and GPT models, integrated Hugging Face model libraries for better natural language processing, created a robust training pipeline with proper data preprocessing, and implemented continuous learning mechanisms to improve responses over time. I also added confidence scoring and fallback mechanisms.
- **Result:** Improved answer generation accuracy by 60.2%, significantly reducing customer support tickets that required human intervention and improving overall customer satisfaction scores.

### 7. **CI/CD & DevOps**

**Question:** "Tell me about your experience with continuous integration and deployment."

**STAR Answer:**

- **Situation:** While working on the T-Mobile application at Infosys, our team of 20+ developers was facing deployment bottlenecks and integration conflicts.
- **Task:** Implement a CI/CD pipeline that would enable seamless code integration and daily deployments for a large development team.
- **Action:** I set up a comprehensive CI/CD pipeline using GitLab with automated testing, code review processes, and deployment automation. Implemented branch protection rules, automated unit and integration testing, deployment staging environments, and automated rollback capabilities. I also integrated code quality checks and security scanning into the pipeline.
- **Result:** Enabled 20+ developers to seamlessly merge code and deploy updates daily, reduced deployment errors by 70%, and decreased the time from code commit to production deployment from hours to minutes.

# SiteTracker Software Engineer Intern Interview Preparation

## Company Overview

SiteTracker is a deployment operations management platform built on Salesforce that helps companies manage critical infrastructure (telecom, utilities, real estate). They work with major clients like British Telecom, KPN, and ChargePoint managing billions in portfolio holdings.

## Expected Interview Questions & STAR Method Answers

### 1. **Technical Architecture & Scalability**

**Question:** "Tell me about a time when you designed a system to handle high concurrent users. How did you approach scalability?"

**STAR Answer:**

- **Situation:** During my internship at Neosoft, I was tasked with building a user profile management system that needed to support thousands of concurrent users.
- **Task:** The system needed to handle 10,000+ concurrent requests while maintaining fast response times and ensuring data consistency.
- **Action:** I architected the system using Node.js with Express.js and implemented clustering with PM2 to utilize all CPU cores. For MongoDB, I created compound indexes on {userId: 1, createdAt: -1} and {email: 1, status: 1} fields, implemented connection pooling using mongoose with maxPoolSize: 50 and bufferMaxEntries: 0. I set up Redis using ioredis client with clustering enabled across 3 nodes for session storage with 24-hour TTL and implemented Redis pub/sub for real-time notifications. For caching, I used Redis with cache-aside pattern, storing user profiles with 15-minute TTL and implementing cache invalidation on updates. I configured MongoDB read replicas using readPreference: 'secondaryPreferred' to distribute read operations. On the frontend, I used React with Redux Toolkit for state management, implemented RTK Query for API caching and data fetching, and used React.memo and useMemo hooks to prevent unnecessary re-renders.
- **Result:** Successfully delivered a system supporting 10,000+ concurrent requests with 99.9% uptime, reducing admin processing time by 30% and improving overall system performance.

### 2. **API Design & Performance Optimization**

**Question:** "Describe a situation where you had to optimize API performance. What was your approach?"

**STAR Answer:**

- **Situation:** At Infosys, I was working on the T-Mobile application where users were experiencing slow response times during peak usage, with some API calls taking 3-5 seconds.
- **Task:** I needed to optimize API performance to handle 200+ requests per second while maintaining sub-second latency.
- **Action:** I implemented dynamic thread pool sizing using Spring Boot's ThreadPoolTaskExecutor with corePoolSize: 10, maxPoolSize: 50, and queueCapacity: 100, replacing the previous static configuration. I integrated OpenTelemetry for distributed tracing using the OpenTelemetry Java agent, creating custom spans to track database queries, external API calls, and business logic execution. I set up New Relic APM for real-time performance monitoring, configuring alerts for response times > 500ms and error rates > 1%. For caching, I implemented Spring Cache with Redis using @Cacheable annotations on frequently accessed methods, with custom cache keys and 10-minute TTL. I optimized database queries by adding composite indexes on (user_id, created_date, status) and implemented pagination using Spring Data JPA's Pageable with custom JPQL queries. For async processing, I used @Async annotation with CompletableFuture for non-critical operations like audit logging and email notifications, and implemented RabbitMQ with Spring AMQP for decoupled message processing using fanout exchanges.
- **Result:** Reduced overall API latency from 3-5 seconds to 400ms (40% improvement), successfully handled 200+ requests per second, and eliminated system bottlenecks. New Relic dashboards showed 99.5% of requests completing under 500ms.

### 3. **Problem-Solving & Debugging**

**Question:** "Tell me about a challenging bug you encountered and how you solved it."

**STAR Answer:**

- **Situation:** During the development of my Chaos Chess project, users reported that the game state was becoming inconsistent during online multiplayer sessions, with pieces appearing in different positions for different players.
- **Task:** I needed to identify the root cause of the synchronization issue and implement a solution that would ensure consistent game state across all connected clients.
- **Action:** I implemented comprehensive logging using Winston with custom formatters, sending logs to both console and file transports with different log levels. I used Django Channels with Redis channel layers for WebSocket management, implementing custom middleware to track connection states. I discovered race conditions by analyzing logs with ELK stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) and identified that moves were being processed out of order. I implemented a turn-based locking mechanism using Redis distributed locks with SETNX commands and 30-second TTL, created atomic game state updates using Django's select_for_update() with nowait=True to prevent deadlocks. For state validation, I implemented JSON schema validation using jsonschema library on both client and server, and created a reconciliation system using diff algorithms (Myers' algorithm implementation) that would compare and sync states every 10 seconds using Django Celery Beat scheduler.
- **Result:** Eliminated synchronization issues, resulting in a 95% reduction in user-reported bugs and enabling smooth multiplayer gameplay for the hackathon win at KJSCE Hack 5.0.

### 4. **Database Design & Optimization**

**Question:** "How would you design a database schema for tracking infrastructure projects with multiple stakeholders?"

**STAR Answer:**

- **Situation:** While working on the distributed file storage system project, I needed to design a database schema that could handle version control, user permissions, and file metadata efficiently across multiple nodes.
- **Task:** Create a scalable database design that could track file versions, user access rights, and maintain data integrity across distributed systems.
- **Action:** I designed a PostgreSQL schema with five main tables: files (id, name, current_version_id, owner_id, created_at), file_versions (id, file_id, version_number, content_hash, size, created_at), users (id, username, email, created_at), permissions (id, user_id, file_id, permission_type, granted_at), and file_chunks (id, version_id, chunk_index, content_hash, storage_location). I implemented B-tree indexes on frequently queried fields: files(owner_id, created_at), file_versions(file_id, version_number), permissions(user_id, file_id), and a composite index on file_chunks(version_id, chunk_index). Used foreign key constraints with CASCADE delete on file_versions to files, and RESTRICT on permissions to prevent accidental data loss. Implemented soft deletes using a deleted_at timestamp column with partial indexes WHERE deleted_at IS NULL. For audit trails, I used PostgreSQL triggers with NEW and OLD record comparisons, storing changes in an audit_log table with JSONB columns for before/after states. Configured connection pooling using PgBouncer with pool_mode=transaction and max_client_conn=1000.
- **Result:** Created a robust system that efficiently managed file versioning with sub-100ms retrieval times for version history and supported complex permission structures, enabling the system to handle large-scale distributed file operations with 20 version rollback capability.

### 5. **Authentication & Security**

**Question:** "Describe your experience implementing authentication and authorization systems."

**STAR Answer:**

- **Situation:** At Neosoft, I was responsible for implementing the security layer for the user profile management system that would handle sensitive user data including PII and financial information.
- **Task:** Implement robust authentication and authorization that would reduce security incidents while maintaining user experience.
- **Action:** I implemented JWT-based authentication using jsonwebtoken library with RS256 algorithm, storing private keys in AWS Secrets Manager and implementing token refresh with sliding window expiration (access token: 15min, refresh token: 7 days). For OAuth 2.0 Google Sign-In, I used Passport.js with passport-google-oauth20 strategy, implementing PKCE flow for additional security. I created RBAC using middleware functions that checked user roles against route permissions stored in Redis sets, implementing granular permissions like 'user:read', 'user:write', 'admin:delete'. Password reset functionality used crypto.randomBytes(32) for secure tokens, stored in Redis with 1-hour TTL, and sent via Nodemailer with SendGrid SMTP. I implemented rate limiting using express-rate-limit with Redis store, setting 5 login attempts per 15 minutes per IP, and used helmet.js for security headers including CSP, HSTS, and XSS protection. Input validation used Joi schema validation with custom sanitization, and I implemented SQL injection prevention using parameterized queries with mongoose and express-validator for request validation.
- **Result:** Reduced security incidents by 25% (from 40 to 30 incidents per month), improved user satisfaction by 15% through seamless Google Sign-In integration, and created a security framework that was adopted across 3 other company projects.

### 6. **Machine Learning Integration**

**Question:** "How would you integrate ML capabilities into a business application?"

**STAR Answer:**

- **Situation:** At Infosys, I was tasked with improving the accuracy of the Equinox AI chatbot that was providing inconsistent responses to customer queries, with accuracy rates below 40%.
- **Task:** Enhance the chatbot's answer generation accuracy and make it more reliable for customer support operations.
- **Action:** I implemented RAG architecture using LangChain framework with FAISS vector database for document retrieval. Fine-tuned LLAMA-7B model using LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) with rank=16, alpha=32, and dropout=0.1, training on 50K customer service conversations using transformers library and PEFT. Integrated Hugging Face Hub using sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2 for embedding generation, storing embeddings in ChromaDB with cosine similarity search. Created preprocessing pipeline using spaCy for text cleaning and tokenization, implemented document chunking with 512-token windows and 50-token overlap using LangChain's RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter. Added confidence scoring using model perplexity calculations and implemented fallback mechanisms with rule-based responses when confidence < 0.7. Used Weights & Biases for experiment tracking and model versioning, implementing A/B testing with 70/30 traffic split to compare model versions. Set up continuous learning pipeline using Apache Airflow, retraining models weekly with new customer interactions stored in PostgreSQL.
- **Result:** Improved answer generation accuracy from 39.8% to 60.2% (60.2% improvement), reduced customer support tickets requiring human intervention by 45%, and achieved 4.2/5.0 customer satisfaction score in post-interaction surveys.

### 7. **CI/CD & DevOps**

**Question:** "Tell me about your experience with continuous integration and deployment."

**STAR Answer:**

- **Situation:** While working on the T-Mobile application at Infosys, our team of 20+ developers was facing deployment bottlenecks with 2-3 failed deployments per week and integration conflicts.
- **Task:** Implement a CI/CD pipeline that would enable seamless code integration and daily deployments for a large development team.
- **Action:** I configured GitLab CI/CD with .gitlab-ci.yml defining 5 stages: build, test, security, staging, and production. Implemented Docker containerization using multi-stage Dockerfiles, reducing image size from 1.2GB to 400MB. Set up automated testing with Jest for unit tests (coverage threshold: 80%), Cypress for E2E tests, and SonarQube for code quality gates with quality profiles enforcing <3% code duplication and Grade A maintainability. Used GitLab Container Registry with vulnerability scanning using Clair, and implemented branch protection rules requiring 2 approvals and passing CI checks. Created staging environment using Kubernetes with Helm charts, implementing blue-green deployments with 5-minute health checks using readiness/liveness probes. Added automated rollback using GitLab's deployment rollback API triggered by error rate thresholds monitored via Prometheus and Grafana. Integrated Slack notifications using webhooks for deployment status and implemented approval workflows for production deployments using GitLab environments with manual deployment gates.
- **Result:** Reduced failed deployments from 2-3 per week to 1 per month, enabled 20+ developers to deploy 3-5 times daily, decreased deployment time from 45 minutes to 8 minutes, and achieved 99.8% deployment success rate with automated rollback preventing any production downtime.
